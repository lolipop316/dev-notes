# Dev Notes

This is where I keep my developer notes, practice code, and small projects.  
It’s mainly front-end work right now (HTML, CSS, JS) as I go through my diploma, but I’ll keep adding more as I learn.

## What’s inside
- `labs/` – small hands-on exercises from daily study
- `projects/` – diploma and FreeCodeCamp builds
- `snippets/` – quick code references and experiments

## Purpose
This repo is for practice and consistency. A lot of it will be rough or unfinished
