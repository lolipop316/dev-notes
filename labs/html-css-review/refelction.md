# Reflection — HTML + CSS Review
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Focus:** Environment setup, HTML structure, CSS layout  

**What went well:**  
- using semantic tags made structure clearer

**What felt clunky:**  
- i didnt know how to make some parts

**What I’ll automate next:**  
- basic HTML boilerplate generation using snippets or Emmet
- Add a basic “live reload + auto-format” setup in my future projects.
